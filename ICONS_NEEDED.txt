ICON FILES NEEDED
=================

This extension requires three icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create these in several ways:

1. Use an online icon generator:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/

2. Use a graphics editor like:
   - GIMP (free)
   - Photoshop
   - Canva (online, free)

3. Use the temp_icon.svg file in this directory:
   - Open it in Inkscape or any SVG editor
   - Export as PNG at the three sizes listed above

4. Use simple colored squares as placeholders:
   - Any image editor can create these quickly

Design suggestions:
- Use blue (#2196F3) as the background
- Add "PS" or "PCRS" text in white
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Make sure the design is clear at 16x16 pixels

Once created, place all three icon files in this directory.
